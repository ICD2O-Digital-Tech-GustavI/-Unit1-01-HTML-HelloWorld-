<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>My name is Gustav, and I'm a grade 10 student at Immaculata High School. <stude></stude></p>
  <h3> My Favourite Pasttime: Playing Board Games, Watching TV, and Playing Video Games</h3>
  <p> I love playing board games since they make me more interconnected with the game and the people around me. I also love watching TV since it makes me feel more connected to the people around me and the show that I'm watching. I also love playing video games because of the several graphics, images and interactions I can execute, allowing me to have liberty when I engage in another world.</p>
  <h5> My least favourite subject : Art </h5>
  <p>Art isn't one of my best classes, I never liked it due to the exaggeration and the vague instructions. Additionally, I would never really use art in real life as I would go into a job that doesn't require me to do so. </p>
